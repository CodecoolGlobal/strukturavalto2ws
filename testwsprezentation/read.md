//from one unit of steam five unit of electricity can be generated
//if input is negative it throws IllegalArgumentException

//There is a reactor class
//There is an public int getStoredUranium() which returns the quantity of uranium in the reactor.
//When we create a new reactor we should be able to set how many uranium are in it.
//There is an public void addUranium(int uraniumToAdd) method. When it's called
//the quantity of uranium stored in the reactor should be increased by the number given in the parameter.
//There is a public int generateSteam(int waterIntake) it returns the quantity of genarated steam by the reactor.
//For one unit of steam one unit of water and one unit of uranium is used.
//If not enough uranium to generete steam from all water it throws NotEnoughUraniumException.
